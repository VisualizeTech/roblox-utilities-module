You do not have to give me credit, it would be nice though :). You can also use this in your commercial
proyects. The reason I chose the CC BY-NC 4.0 license is because I will not allow it to be reselled as it
is, however, you can use it in commercial proyects whose main purpose is not to resell or take advantage of
this module directly.

    Background Load is a property that dictates whether the cron job should load jobs in the background. This
